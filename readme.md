# Hello guys and gals! Welcome to Fjelltrollet's github.  
------
## I will primarily use this account for free-time projects. This will be a good opportunity for me to learn new things
-----
#### Some quick facts:

* *I have never really done pure web projects (by pure I mean html, js, css files, and the like) in the past six years. I mostly write in Java (Thanks to Vaadin, I never had to  write html and javascript codes) and C#, with some experience in CSS, and I have mostly worked with fullstack-development (but I tend to be better on the back-end, to be honest).*

* *Game development always amazes me, tbh.  I'd love to make some good websites too, and desktop applications as well... *



*I hope that I get more skills by doing hobby projects (or know more things at least)
I will most likely commit and push things to git on weekends when I have a bit of spare time.*
