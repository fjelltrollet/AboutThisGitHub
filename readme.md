# Hello guys and gals! Welcome to Fjelltrollet's github.  
------
## I will primarily use this account for free-time projects. This will be a good opportunity for me to learn new things
-----
#### Some quick facts:

* *I have never really done pure web projects (by pure I mean html, js, css files, and the like) in the past six years. I mostly write in Java (Thanks to Vaadin, I never had to  write html and javascript codes) and C#, with some experience in CSS, and I have mostly worked with fullstack-development (but I tend to be better on the back-end, to be honest).*

* *Game development always amazes me, tbh.  I'd love to make some good websites too, and desktop applications as well... *

* *The pushes on this github might be irregular, as I like to travel, and I might have some plans during holidays (e.g. christmas) 

* *Outside programming, I love science, gaming, and playing badminton (I'm not good at it, but I still love it. lol). I also love to be with my friends. *

* *Front-end or back-end? both! I would like to retain my skills as much as possible.*

###### I hope that I get more skills by doing hobby projects (or know more things at least). I will most likely commit and push things to git on weekends when I have a bit of spare time.

__N.B. *Expect an informal github. hahahaha. *__
